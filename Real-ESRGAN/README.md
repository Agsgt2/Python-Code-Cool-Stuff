Summary : <br/>


<font size= "4" >
Check out the latest real-ESRGAN tutorial for a comprehensive guide on how to use the real-ESRGAN image upscaler to improve image quality and resolution

Real-ESRGAN aims at developing Practical Algorithms for General Image/Video Restoration.
We extend the powerful ESRGAN to a practical restoration application (namely, Real-ESRGAN), which is trained with pure synthetic data.

<br/><br/> 


The tutorial is divided into 3 parts:

🖼️ Part 1: Setting up a Conda environment for seamless development and Installing essential Python libraries.

🧠 Part 2: Cloning the GitHub repository containing the code and resources.

🚀 Part 3: Apply the model on your own images
