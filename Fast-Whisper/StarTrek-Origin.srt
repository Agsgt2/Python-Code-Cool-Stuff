00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 Captain's log, stardate 1324.1.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
 On planet M113, we encounter a killer from a lost world.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 Red modeling all over his face.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 What happened?

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 What do you suppose happened, Captain?

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 You beamed down a crewman who doesn't know better than to eat a...

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 I've just lost a crewman, Mrs. Crater. I want to know what happened.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 And what kills a healthy man?

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 I'll tell you something else.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 This man shouldn't be dead.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 I can't find anything wrong with him.

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 According to all the tests, he should get up and just walk away from here.

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 Can you recognize this thing when you see it?

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 Professor, I'll forego charges up to this point.

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 But this creature's aboard my ship.

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 And I'll have it. Or I'll have your skin. Or both.

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 Now, where is it?

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 I'll kill to stay alone.

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 You hear that, Crack?

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 Crater knows the creature. If we can take him alive...

21
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 We don't want you here!

22
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 Let's get him.

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 To be continued...
