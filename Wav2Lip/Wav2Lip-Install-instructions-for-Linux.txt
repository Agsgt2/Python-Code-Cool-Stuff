Here are the steps to install Miniconda on Linux:




Hi there,
I've devoted a lot of time and effort to creating this content. 
If you could show your appreciation by buying me a coffee for just $1, I would be truly grateful : https://ko-fi.com/eranfeit

1. Download Miniconda installer Go to the Miniconda download page: https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html Download the latest version of the Miniconda installer script for Linux. You can choose between Python 2 or Python 3 versions.
2. Run the installer script Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you downloaded the installer script. Run the following command to make the script executable:

chmod +x Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh

Then run the script:
./Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh


3. Follow the installer prompts The installer will prompt you to review the license agreement. Press Enter to view it, type "yes" to accept and continue. It will then ask you to specify the installation location. You can press Enter to use the default location (your home directory).

4. Initialize Miniconda After installation, you need to initialize Miniconda. The installer should prompt you to run either . ~/.bashrc or source ~/.bashrc to do this.

5. Verify installation Once initialized, you should be able to run conda commands. Test it by running:
conda --version

This should print the installed Conda version.
