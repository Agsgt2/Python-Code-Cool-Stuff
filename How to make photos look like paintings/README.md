The tutorial is divided into several parts:

1: Showcase the conversion process using Stylized Neural Painting.

2: Setup Environment: Guide through cloning the repository, downloading models, and creating a Conda environment.

3: Running the Model: Show how to copy an image and adjust stroke counts for GPU memory.

4: Generating an Oil Painting: Explain parameters and run the command for oil painting conversion.

5: Generating a Marker-Pen Painting: Demonstrate marker-pen painting generation with different parameters.
