Summary : <br/>


<font size= "4" >
Image animation brings life to the static face in the source image according to the driving video,  using the Thin-Plate Spline Motion Model! 
<br/><br/> 

The tutorial is divided into five parts:

🖼️ Part 1: Setting up the Environment: We'll walk you through creating a Conda environment with the right Python libraries to ensure a smooth animation process.

🧠 Part 2: Cloning the GitHub Repository

🚀 Part 3: Download the Model Weights

🔮 Part 4: Run a demo , and Use Your Own Images and Video
